      <h3>Why E-KART?</h3>
      <p>There is a E-KART within each one of us, the burning flame that's constantly pushing us to follow our dreams.
        It is this inner E-Kart that drove <b>ANKUSH ARORA</b> to develop their own website, in <b>2023.</b> </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Beginning.</h3>
      <p>E-KART started out selling <b>keyboards,mouses,earphones,watchs,pendrives</b> because these
        accessories would be the next big thing in India. E-KART diversified into smart wearables and wireless headphones. E-KART was one of the first website in India to offer truly products
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>The Future.</h3>
      <p>E-KART is renewing its focus on smart wearables & hearables. (wireless headphones with advanced features) We aim to be the biggest player in the Indian market,
